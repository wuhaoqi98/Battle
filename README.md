# Battle
A 2D Strategy game with AI control.
The assets are from Unity Tank tutorial assets and are modified for game purposes.
I developed this game for interests and you can download the executable and try it out yourself!

How to play:
P1: 
W, A, S, D -- control movement of commander vehicle 
Space -- fire with commander vehicle
Number 1-6 -- produce units
Left Shift -- build oil rig
I -- turn on AI for P2

P2:
Up, Down, Left, Right arrow keys -- control movement of commander vehicle 
Enter -- fire with commander vehicle
Number 7-0, -, + -- produce units
Right Shift -- build oil rig 

You need to destroy opponent's commander vehicle to win the battle. In order to do so, you need to maximize your production by building oil rigs and produce different units strategically. The units are controlled by AI and will automatically find the targets based on the priority (opponent units > structures > commander vihecle). Your commander vihecle can regenerate health and you can fight with it but it's more important to produce units. There is also oil in the center of the map where players can try to grab it for income boost.
